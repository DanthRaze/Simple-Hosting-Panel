**|** From here you can now basically do anything, it's quite simple. Start will launch your server and all buttons will do as expected. There is a live console which you can send commands with and receive commands.



Hope you enjoy, there may be some glitched as we are in an early stage but all shall be fixed soon. Hopefully this helps you!
